## [0.5.4] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- Merged Claude Developer Tool and Codex Developer Tool into a single application: Agent CLI DevKit. All features of both tools are now available in one app, with the dashboard and title-bar navigation grouped by agent (Claude / Codex).

### Fixed

- Codex official skill import showed an empty list because the official openai/skills repository moved its catalog to a new location. The importer now finds the official skills again.
